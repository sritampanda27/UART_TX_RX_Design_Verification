# UART_TX_RX_Design_Verification

The Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) is a key communication protocol widely used for serial data transmission in embedded systems. This project focuses on the design and verification of a UART transmitter and receiver, where data is sent serially in 8-bit packets. The design is implemented in Verilog HDL, ensuring that the UART components are synthesizable and meet the required specifications.
A comprehensive testbench is developed to perform functional verification of the UART modules, validating their operation under various scenarios and ensuring reliable data transmission and reception. The testbench simulates different data patterns and baud rates to thoroughly test the UART design.
